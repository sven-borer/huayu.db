All vocabulary and grammar of the Practical Audio Visual Chinese book series can be found in here. I created it to easily lookup examples and find grammar patterns over all the examples provided in the books.

The vocabulary/grammar of the following books is in the database:

Practical Audio Visual Chinese 1 (not yet in database)\
Practical Audio Visual Chinese 2\
Practical Audio Visual Chinese 3\
Practical Audio Visual Chinese 4 (not yet in database)

More to come.
